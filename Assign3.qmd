## Assignment 3: Linear Regression

I have already installed the libraries that you will need for this assignment. Please run the chunk below to load the libraries. Note that I am using "#\| include: false" so that your libraries code chunk will run, but not appear in your rendered document.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(esquisse)
library(readxl) #for loading data from Excel files
library(janitor) #for data cleaning help
library(naniar) #visualizing missingness
library(mice) #imputation
library(ggcorrplot) #correlation plots
```

Load the dataset using the code below.

```{r}
sales = read_csv("vehicle_sales.csv")
```

Let's start the assignment. As you did on the first R assignment you can write your non-code answers in plain text (outside of R code chunks). Please create any R code chunks that you may need for your code. Use the green button at top right (see screenshot below) to create new chunks.

You may use the esquisse package for your data visualizations (if you wish).

**Task 1:** How many rows and columns are there in the dataset?

### There are 118 rows and 5 columns.

**Task 2:** Examine the structure of the dataset and then convert the "Condition" variable to a factor.

**Task 3**: The "SalePrice" variable will be our response variable in our linear regression models. Develop appropriate plots of each of the other four variables versus "SalePrice".

Each plot should be accompanied by a short comment on the relationship between the variable the "SalePrice".

Do these relationships match your intuition?

**Task 4**: Create a correlation plot for the numeric variables. Hint: You will need to exclude one of the variables as it is not numeric.

Which variable is most strongly correlated with SalePrice? Which is most weakly correlated?

**Task 5**: Build a linear regression model with the strongest variable (identified in Task 4). Comment on the quality of the model.

**Task 6**: Build a linear regression model with the weakest variable (identified in Task 4). Comment on the quality of the model.

**Task 7**: Build a linear regression model with the Condition variable as the predictor (use only Condition, no other predictor variables). Comment on the quality of the model.

**Task 8:** Create a model with all variables as predictors of SalePrice. Comment on the quality of the model. Note: Your results may be displayed in scientific notation. This is OK. Adding the code: options(scipen = 999) in the line above your model code will suppress scientific notation (if desired).
